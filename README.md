# Ask_Robo 🤖

**Ask_Robo** is a lightweight AI voice assistant powered by the Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis APIs built with JavaScript. It listens to your voice commands and performs actions like opening popular websites or performing Google searches.

## Features 🌟

- **Voice Commands:** Interact with the assistant using voice commands.
  
- **Open Websites:** Say commands like "Open YouTube" or "Open Google" to navigate to those websites.
  
- **Google Search:** For unrecognized commands, it automatically performs a Google search.
  
- **Text-to-Speech:** Responds to your commands with voice feedback.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI with a start button.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Speech Recognition:** Listens to your voice and converts it into text using the Web Speech API.
2. **Command Handling:** Matches your commands with pre-defined actions like opening websites.
3. **Fallback Search:** Performs a Google search for commands not explicitly recognized.
4. **Speech Feedback:** Uses the Speech Synthesis API to provide voice responses.
